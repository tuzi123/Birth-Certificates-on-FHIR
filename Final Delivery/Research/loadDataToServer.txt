1. Use Docker to connect with the FHIR server (Piazza @494)

This command will launch the container:
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name=my-fhir-server djohnson325/hapi-fhir-jpaserver:stu3
Then point your web browser to:
http://localhost:8080/

Couple more commands...
To see that the container is running
docker ps
To stop the container
docker stop my-fhir-server
To start it back up again
docker start my-fhir-server

2. Use tag-uploader to upload BabyBoy iHealth.json to FHIR server
